# Covid-19-Analysis
Data Analysis Project. Exploring reasons and insights of the Widespread Pandemic.
The most crucial thing in analyzing a pandemic is to ensure that all the factors that are responsible for the
outbreak are well considered. Missing out on any of such factors, however trivial it might seem, will not give an
accurate analysis. What makes this type of analysis challenging is the number of factors that keep varying across
different countries. Considering the common and important ones which can be relied on for accurate analysis is
what we get to learn from this project.

Sometimes drilling down to root cause for analysis can turn out to be a futile effort. But identifying the right factors
to do right analysis is equally important for analysing this kind of varying data. To name a few factors in the dataset
that play a key role to help us analyse the outbreak are total cases, total deaths, total tests, population,
recommendation delay, lockdown delay, health care index and many more. Data analysis of this dataset is needed
to identify the direct and indirect relation between these variables. Using the existing statistics to identify such
correlation can help countries in future to mitigate the widespread in case of such recurring pandemic. This has
been the main interest behind analysing the dataset. 

Analysing data for the COVID-19 pandemic is very important. There are few countries who were successful in
controlling and few who were not. Despite a good health care index, some countries still failed miserably in
controlling the widespread. Some, despite having more population, had fewer cases as compared to other
countries with a smaller population size but a lot of positive corona infected cases. At this point it becomes difficult
to consider which factors can be assumed to help countries from preventing the spread of this virus. This analysis
will tell us that it is not just one or two factors that are essential but a combination of multiple factors that needs to
be addressed and focused up on equally, which will help us to control the widespread and also on how to put an
end to this pandemic or any such pandemic in future.
